## Introducing the FOCUS 250

The FOCUS 250 represents an innovative solar parabolic dish concentrator design capable of delivering an abundance of clean, inexpensive thermal energy for a wide range of applications.

### The most efficient solar thermal energy technology

Utilizing dual-axis tracking, the FOCUS 250 maximizes solar energy capture year-round. As a thermal system, the full spectrum of solar irradiance is captured, and losses resulting from conversion into electricity are avoided. The result is a system delivering approximately 80% conversion of available solar irradiance into thermal energy - far higher than competing technologies.

### Designed from inception for minimum cost

The FOCUS 250 has been designed from the ground up to minimize the Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH) over the lifetime of the system. Built from environmentally resilient low-cost metal components, the FOCUS 250 is manufactured using proven techniques borrowed from the aerospace and automotive industries. Mast-mounted, the FOCUS 250 is highly land-efficient per unit of energy generated. Installation and calibration are streamlined, as the FOCUS 250 requires limited land preparation and utilizes an auto-calibration process.
