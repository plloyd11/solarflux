We are pleased to share that we have been awarded a $340,000 grant by the Met-Ed / Penelec Sustainable Energy Fund, administered by the [Berks County Community Foundation](https://bccf.org/) (BCCF) and the [Community Foundation for the Alleghenies](https://cfalleghenies.org/) (CFA).

The funds will be used to assist with the implementation of a volume production process for key components of the FOCUS concentrator, enabling us to advance towards our goal of offering a cost-competitive solar thermal energy solution. We are proud and honored to have been selected as the recipient of this grant and appreciate the faith and trust bestowed upon us by the selection committee.

"With this funding, we plan to increase production speed and capacity, and dramatically reduce unit costs," said Naoise Irwin, Solarflux's chairman.

Founded in 2019, Solarflux Energy Technologies, Inc. offers the FOCUS, a parabolic dish concentrator capable of producing low-cost solar thermal energy for a range of applications.
